## Questions
- "Start Megascans Livelink Octane" is greyed out
  - The active render engine is not octane
- "Megascans LiveLink Octane is started already"
  - You already started the addon. The socket client will last in background until you quit the Blender
- I cannot see imported surface materials
  - Surface material will not be assigned to selected objects automatically. Instead, you can find it in the Material Slots from Nodes editor
- Mesh is imported without a correct material and the console prints "key 'Principled BSDF' not found"
  - There is a confict when both official addon and my addon are installed on a same machine
  - Remove the official addon
    - If you found a folder called "MSPlugin" in C:\Users\[Your username]\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.8X\scripts\startup, kill it and repeat steps to install the addon and restart the Blender
- Other issues
  - Please check the log from Blender > Topbar > Window > Toggle System Console and let me know what's happening

## Upgrading

1. Remove the addon in the settings and relaunch the OC Blender 
3. Follow instructions to install the addon

Otherwise, socket running in the thread will cause a problem

## Features
> Please turn on the **Specular map** option when you download the assets and export them from the Bridge, otherwise, the specular value will be set to 0.5 by default

> Surface materials will **not** be assigned to selected objects, instead, you can find it in the material slots in Node editor
